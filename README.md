# Causal Modeling with Variational Autoencoder
This project aims to train an variational autoencoder using Deepmind's dSprites dataset.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to detect whether there's a deep causal relationship between the 6 ground truth independent factors that aggregately determine a dSprite image. 

## Dataset
dSprites is a dataset of sprites, which are 2D shapes procedurally generated from 6 ground truth independent "factors." These factors are color, shape, scale, rotation, x and y positions of a sprite.

All possible combinations of these variables are present exactly once, generating N = 737280 total images.

Factors and their values:

* Shape: 3 values {square, ellipse, heart} <br/>

* Scale: 6 values linearly spaced in (0.5, 1) <br/>

* Orientation: 40 values in (0, 2 Ï€ )<br/>

Further, the objective of any generative model is essentially to capture underlying data generative factors, the disentangled representation would mean a single latent unit being sensitive to variations in single generative factors

## What is Variational AutoEncoder

- Overview

- Flow

* Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features that describe some data (either by selecting only a subset of the initial features or by combining them into a reduced number new features) and, so, can be seen as an encoding process
* Autoencoders are neural networks architectures composed of both an encoder and a decoder that create a bottleneck to go through for data and that are trained to lose a minimal quantity of information during the encoding-decoding process

## Optimization:
* The code is made compatible for GPU for faster processing.
* The learned weights are saved to avoid training frequently to enhance development efficiency.
